					<li><h2>Individualized Supported Living (ISL)</h2></li>
					<li><p>ISL is a form of residential habilitation that allows the people we support the opportunity of community living regardless of his/her competency, severity of disability, or the degree of any physical or behavioral challenges the person may have.</p></li>
					<li><p> Individuals may live alone, with a host family, or may share a living arrangement with others. When living arrangements are shared, no more than four individuals with disabilities may reside together and qualify for ISL services. Emphasis is placed on individuals choosing where they reside, with whom they reside, and the type of community activities in which they wish to be involved. Supports are individually designed and coordinated to enable their living. </p></li>
					<li><p>The <b>staff's responsibility</b> is to support and assist each individual. Every aspect of an ISL must involve the person who lives there. Assist people in doing things for themselves by using hand-over-hand assistance, physically assisting them, or verbally prompting them.</p></li>
					<li><h2>Respite and Personal Care Assistance</h2></li>
					<li><p>Respite and personal care assistance services are provided to families who need assistance caring for a family member who has a disability in their own home. Support staff who provide this service must meet all requirements of the support staff job description, as well as adhere to policy and procedures.</p></li>
					<li><h2>Supported Employment</h2></li>
					<li><p>The goal of supported employment services are: to teach and train lifelong job skills to people with disabilities, find and maintain employment for consumers receiving the services the service.Consumers who are enrolled in the program will be alloted a set number of hours each month to work with TJ Swift House employees in an environment conducive to vocational training. Supported employment services utilize a three prong approach in the following areas: Job skills training, job development, and job assistance. Job skills training will focus on teaching the consumer basic requirements and the social skills necessary for employment. Job development will focus on assisting the consumer in obtaining employment. Lastly, job assistance will focus on TJ Swift House employees providing oversight and side by side assistance to consumers at the job site once employment has been obtained. Job skills training and job development services are a time limited service. However, job assistance services can last a lifetime if the team feels it is a necessary service for the consumer being served.</p></li> 
					<li><h2>Shared Living</h2></li>
					<li><h2>Behavioral Intensive Homes</h2></li>

					<li><p>Behavior intensive homes are shift homes that are focused on supporting consumers who require a greater level of care due to increased behavioral needs. These homes are identified as such by the Department of Mental Health (DMH). Behavior intensive homes have an elevated day rate due to the intense supports required. By design, the homes are not meant to be long term placements. The goal for these homes is to teach qualifying consumers better coping skills so they may eventually transfer to a traditional ISL once he/she no longer requires this level of oversight. Staff must apply specifically to work in behavior intensive homes. Additional and more intensive training is required and a higher pay scale is paid to employees working in behavioral intensive homes.</p></li>
